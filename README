To detect anomalies we assume that the square of the Z component of the
accellelometer are normally distributed.

Why the square? A Z component can be either negative or positive and we are
going to compute means and the standard deviations. We are not interested in the
classification of the anomaly and a positive value can be handled easily.

For the detection we use the 68–95–99.7 rule.

Let X a random variable of the event that we are observing (the Z axis of the 
accellelometer), u = E[X] and o the standard deviation.

Empirically, those probabilities holds:

Pr[u -o <= X <= u +o] ~ 0.6827
Pr[u -2*o <= X <= u +2*o] ~ 0.9545
Pr[u -3*o <= X <= u +3*o] ~ 0.9973

Using these 3 rules we can detect anomalies seeing if an observation violates
this rules.
